										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5>Step into a world of unmatched luxury with Nayla, our exquisitely crafted footwear masterpiece. Designed to capture the essence of sophistication and engineered for ultimate comfort, Nayla is the epitome of elegance, making every step you take a graceful expression of style.</h5>
<h5><b>Luxurious Design:<br />
</b><br />
Nayla&#8217;s design is a harmonious fusion of timeless elegance and contemporary allure. From the finest materials to the intricate details, every element is meticulously chosen to ensure a refined and sophisticated look. The sleek lines and graceful curves of Nayla add a touch of opulence to any outfit, be it formal or casual.</h5>
<h5><b>Premium Materials:</b></h5>
<h5>At the heart of Nayla lies the dedication to quality. Crafted from the finest leather and adorned with exquisite embellishments, Nayla guarantees both durability and unparalleled charm. Our artisans pay meticulous attention to detail, handcrafting each pair to perfection, ensuring you receive a product that stands the test of time</h5>
<h5>Directly inspired by trivial everyday objects, PION is the first piece in a collection which, through color and simplicity of form, attempts to reconcile the adult and the child. With a minimalist look, the piece of furniture is not limited to a single use. Thus PION can be a stool, a side table or a bedside table. Solo monochrome or well accompanied polychrome.</h5>
<h5>— Blue colored stool made in France from recycled steel, assembled by hand and then powder coated.</h5>
<h5>Made in France from recycled steel, these stools are assembled by hand and then powder coated. Steel is for sturdiness and for the stability that its weight gives to the seat. And powder coating, for the introduction of color and the perfect stretch that underlines the design and plays with reflections. Contact us for special finishes.</h5>
