<h5>Directly inspired by trivial everyday objects, PION is the first piece in a collection which, through color and simplicity of form, attempts to reconcile the adult and the child.

<h5>— Blue colored stool made in France from recycled steel, assembled by hand and then powder coated.</h5>
<h5>Made in France from recycled steel, these stools are assembled by hand and then powder coated. Steel is for sturdiness and for the stability that its weight gives to the seat. And powder coating, for the introduction of color and the perfect stretch that underlines the design and plays with reflections. Contact us for special finishes.</h5>
